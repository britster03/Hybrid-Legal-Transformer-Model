# Hybrid Legal Transformer Model for Enhanced Legal Text Generation

## Overview

This project presents a novel approach to fine-tuning a language model for specialized legal text generation. By integrating a Legal Knowledge Graph (LKG), a Symbolic Reasoning Module (SRM), an Adaptive Attention Mechanism, and incorporating Meta-Learning and Expert Feedback, this model aims to enhance the accuracy, speed, and compliance of generated legal texts.
